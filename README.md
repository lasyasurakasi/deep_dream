# 🌀 Deep Dream with TensorFlow

A step-by-step implementation of Google's Deep Dream using TensorFlow and a pre-trained InceptionV3 model.

## 🔍 What is Deep Dream?

Deep Dream is a neural network visualization technique that enhances patterns in images, creating dream-like, surreal visuals. It works by maximizing activations in certain layers of a pre-trained CNN.

## 🚀 Features

- TensorFlow 2.x with eager execution
- Pretrained InceptionV3 model
- Layer-wise dreaming
- Works on custom input images
- Save & view outputs
